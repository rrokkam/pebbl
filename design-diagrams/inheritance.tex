\begin{enumerate}
\item[\textbf{Problem}] When running PEBBL with just 1 worker, it will think it is in serial,
even if it has a group of bounding processors. To communicate with its bounding processors, the
worker needs to have MPI capabilities and some knowledge about how to pass subproblems, which is
not included in the serial layer of PEBBL. 

\item[\textbf{Proposal}] To avoid polluting the serial layer of PEBBL with MPI functionality, we
would like to reorganize the class hierarchy to include serial/parallel versions of both branching
and bounding. These new classes would be derived from a pure virtual class which encapsulates the
message packing. The result is the diamond hierarchy below:

\item[\textbf{Potential issues}] Because information about the head and bounding communicators is
required when doing both parallel branching and parallel bounding, we chose to include instances of
mpiComm as members of parBranchSerialBound and serialBranchParBound. We know you wanted parBranching
to be derived from mpiComm, so we are especially interested in your thoughts on this decision.
